# BiggaGiggas - John Rekevics Sax Library
SFZPack of Bigga Giggas - The John Rekevics Saxophone Library (2003)

## Sample files placement
Extract the samples from the `gig` files of the library to these folders. Make sure to extract the Sustain and Vibrato samples seperately from the rest of articulations, specially the ones that are supposed to be V3 but the filenames are identical inside of the gig files.
